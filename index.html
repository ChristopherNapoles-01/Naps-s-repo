			<p>Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
			<p>A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans. 
				"What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals," Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, said. 
				It's not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be, but fatality rates are currently lower than both MERS and SARS. Experts stress that it will change as the outbreak develops.</p>
			<p class="secHeading">Most common symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fever</li>
				<li>Dry cough</li>
				<li>Tiredness</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="secHeading">Less common symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Aches and pains</li>
				<li>Sore throat</li>
				<li>Diarrhea</li>
				<li>Conjunctivitis</li>
				<li>Headache</li>
				<li>Loss of taste or smell</li>
				<li>rash on skin, discolor of fingers or toes</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="secHeading">Serious symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty of breathing or shortness of breathing</li>
				<li>Chest pain or pressure</li>
				<li>Loss of speech of movement</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.</p>
			<p>On average it takes 5 - 6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however in some cases it can take up to 14 days before the symptoms occur.</p>
